## Overview

This project implements a Snake Game where the AI learns to play the game autonomously using reinforcement learning. The model is trained to navigate the snake on the game board, avoiding collisions with walls and itself while trying to maximize its score.

## Features

- Reinforcement Learning: The AI agent is trained using a reinforcement learning algorithm to make autonomous decisions during the game.
- Training Curves: Visualize the learning progress with training curves that demonstrate the agent's improvement over time.
